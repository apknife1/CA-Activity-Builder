      Tell me about your experience using carpentry hand and power tools on site.
      What sort of jobs have you been doing and what was your role with the tools
      on those jobs?

    - >
      When you are getting ready to use carpentry tools and equipment on a job,
      how do you plan the work and set up the area? Talk me through how you read
      the instructions, choose your PPE, and check the work area and services
      before you start.

    - >
      Think about a recent carpentry task you have done, like framing or fixing.
      Walk me through how you chose which hand tools, power tools and pneumatic
      tools to use, how you checked they were safe and serviceable, and how you
      used them through the job.

    - >
      Can you tell me how you look after your tools day to day? Describe how you
      sharpen and hone your chisels and plane blades, and how you safely change
      blades, cutters or grinding discs on tools such as circular saws, planers,
      routers or grinders.

    - >
      After you finish using tools on a job, what do you do to clean up and pack
      up? Explain how you deal with waste, check and maintain the tools, store or
      secure them, and report any faults you find.
